# Tau

Tau is an open source multi-purpose Discord bot written in Python with a focus on fair server moderation.
To protect users against power-hungry and overzealous moderators, Tau implements a democratic moderation system where power is evenly distributed among all staff members without inhibiting their ability to do their job. In effect, users are treated more fairly and have the right to appeal if they are punished.
